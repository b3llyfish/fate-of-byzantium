[h1] Fate Of Byzantium [/h1]
Mod the aims to control Byzantium (and the Admin Government in general) following their post Roads to Power implementation.

With this mod Byzantium should be: 
* a regional power that still poses a challenge to fight
* unable to expand so freely in all directions
* vulnerable to internal factions and invading realms

There are two mains parts to this mod:
* a new thematic struggle for Byzantium (can be disabled via game rules)
* nerfs/tweaks/fixes to Administrative governments

[h2] Key Details [/h2]
* new Byzantine Struggle mechanic affecting the Byzantine's ability to wage war
* Populist factions no longer fight for the state faith, instead behaving like they do in other governments
* Increased conditions for internal factions to form, giving Admin governments more threats
* Seljuk invasion event for pre-1178 starts, allowing Rum to pose an issue to Byzantium

[h2] Disclaimer [/h2]
This mod is an attempt to balance CK3's overpowered implementation of Byzantium via game mechanics. It is not trying to be a historically 
accurate portrayal of Byzantium.

Please remember this if you are planning on leaving comments.

[h2] Observations [/h2]
Below list the general behaviour of Byzantium and Rum across the start dates.

Obviously the AI is unpredictable, so I cannot guarantee this behaviour.

[h3] 867 [/h3]
Byzantium is at its strongest in this start date and will try to pick off bits of Italy and the Balkans. Once King Boris of Bulgaria dies
Byzantium often subjects and dissolves Bulgaria, allowing Greek rule over those themes.

Around 910 the stagnation phase kicks in and Byzantium will lose its ability to expand so easily.

[h3] 1066 [/h3]
Byzantium is attempting to hold things together in this start, however a scripted Islamic invasion of Anatolia combined
with various claimant factions will see the Empire start to fray and splinter.

Opportunistic attacks will be common against Byzantium. It is in this start date that the 'Fall of Byzantium' ending
is likeliest to happen.

[h3] 1178 [/h3]
I'm of the opinion that the economy in this start date is completely broken and so any attempts to balance this mod for this
start date is ultimately pointless. 

That said the buffs given to Rum it typically allows them to repel Byzantium's initial attempts to annex it from the map in one war.

Conqueror Saladin will likely waltz up and consume Rum but that's not an issue this mod is trying to solve.

[h2] Game Rules [/h2]

[h2] Recommended Mods [/h2]
* [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3357686271]Worthy Conquerors[/url] - prevent struggle participants from becoming conquerors and can remove Saladin's conqueror trait via a game rule

[h2] Compatibility [/h2]
There are a bunch of overrides (populists, rum, governor efficiency, etc...) made by this mod. It is unlikely to cause
any crashes with other mods that override these things but be aware you may get a different experience.

[h2] Localisation [/h2]
I welcome any localisation mods. Please let me know if you make one, and I will add a link.
