[h1] Fate Of Byzantium [/h1]
[b]This mod is functional however I am still assessing All Under Heaven's impact[/b]

Mod that aims to control Byzantium (and the Admin Government in general) following their post Roads to Power implementation.

With this mod Byzantium should be:
* a regional power that still poses a challenge to fight
* unable to expand so freely in all directions
* vulnerable to internal factions and invading realms

There are two mains parts to this mod:
* a new thematic struggle for Byzantium (can be disabled via game rules)
* nerfs/tweaks/fixes to Administrative governments

[h2] Key Details [/h2]
* New Byzantine Struggle mechanic for the Byzantine region
* Economic changes to Byzantium, whilst still comparatively rich they no longer print money
* Populist factions no longer fight for the state faith, instead behaving like they do in other governments
* Reworked Governor Efficiency score, high scores will be more difficult to achieve
* Seljuk invasion event for pre-1178 starts, allowing Rum to pose an issue to Byzantium
* Admin governments for Asia (if you do not have All Under Heaven)

[h2] Disclaimer [/h2]
This mod is an attempt to balance CK3's overpowered implementation of Byzantium via game mechanics. It is not trying to be a historically accurate portrayal of Byzantium.

Please remember this if you are planning on leaving comments.

[h2] Recommended Mods [/h2]

[h2] Compatibility [/h2]
There are a bunch of overrides (populists, rum, governor efficiency, etc...) made by this mod. It is unlikely to cause any crashes with other mods that override these things but be aware you may get a different experience.

I welcome any localisation mods. Please let me know if you make one, and I will add a link.
