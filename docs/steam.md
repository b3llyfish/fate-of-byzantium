[h1] Fate Of Byzantium [/h1]
Mod the aims to control Byzantium (and the Admin Government in general) following their post Roads to Power implementation.

There are two parts to this mod:
* a new thematic struggle for Byzantium (can be disabled via game rules)
* nerfs/tweaks/fixes to administrative governments

[h2] Key Details [/h2]
* new Byzantine Struggle mechanic affecting the Byzantine's ability to wage war
* Populist factions no longer fight for the state faith, instead behaving like they do in other governments
* Increased conditions for internal factions to form, giving Admin governments more threats
* Seljuk invasion event for pre-1187 starts, allowing Rum to pose an issue to Byzantium

For the full change log please view the [url=https://github.com/b3llyfish/fate-of-byzantium/blob/main/README.md]README[/url] for this mod.

[h2] Disclaimer [/h2]
This mod is an attempt and balance CK3's overpowered implementation of Byzantium. It is not trying to be a historically 
accurate portrayal of Byzantium.

The mod isn't able to incorporate the 'Name of Byzantium' game rule into the localisation.

Please remember this if you are planning on leaving comments.

[h2] Compatibility [/h2]
There are a bunch of overrides (populists, rum, governor efficiency, etc...) made by this mod. It is unlikely to cause
any crashes with other mods that override these things but be aware you may get a different experience.

This mod has been designed with Cultures Expanded enabled and would recommend installing it.

[h2] Localisation [/h2]
I welcome any localisation mods. Please let me know if you make one, and I will add a link.
