[h1] Fate Of Byzantium [/h1]
Mod the aims to control Byzantium (and the Admin Government in general) following their post Roads to Power implementation.

With this mod Byzantium should be:
* a regional power that still poses a challenge to fight
* unable to expand so freely in all directions
* vulnerable to internal factions and invading realms

There are two mains parts to this mod:
* a new thematic struggle for Byzantium (can be disabled via game rules)
* nerfs/tweaks/fixes to Administrative governments

[h2] Key Details [/h2]
* New Byzantine Struggle mechanic affecting the Byzantine's ability to wage war
* Populist factions no longer fight for the state faith, instead behaving like they do in other governments
* Increased conditions for internal factions to form, giving Admin governments more threats
* Seljuk invasion event for pre-1178 starts, allowing Rum to pose an issue to Byzantium

[h2] Disclaimer [/h2]
This mod is an attempt to balance CK3's overpowered implementation of Byzantium via game mechanics. It is not trying to be a historically accurate portrayal of Byzantium.

Please remember this if you are planning on leaving comments.
