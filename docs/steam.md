[h1] Fate Of Byzantium [/h1]
Mod the aims to control Byzantium (and the Admin Government in general) following their post Roads to Power implementation.

There are two parts to this mod:
* a new thematic struggle for Byzantium (can be disabled via game rules)
* nerfs/tweaks/fixes to administrative governments

[h2] Key Details [/h2]
* new Byzantine Struggle mechanic affecting the Byzantine's ability to wage war
* Populist factions no longer fight for the state faith, instead behaving like they do in other governments
* Increased conditions for internal factions to form, giving Admin governments more threats
* Seljuk invasion event for pre-1178 starts, allowing Rum to pose an issue to Byzantium

For the full change log please view the [url=https://github.com/b3llyfish/fate-of-byzantium/blob/main/README.md]README[/url] for this mod.

[h2] Disclaimer [/h2]
This mod is an attempt and balance CK3's overpowered implementation of Byzantium. It is not trying to be a historically 
accurate portrayal of Byzantium.

The mod isn't able to incorporate the 'Name of Byzantium' game rule into the localisation.

Please remember this if you are planning on leaving comments.

[h2] Byzantium Observations [/h2]
Below lists my observations of Byzantium with this mod on for each start date.
Obviously the AI is unpredictable, so I cannot guarantee this behaviour.

[h3] 867 [/h3]
Byzantium is at its strongest in this start date and will try to pick off bits of Italy and the Balkans. Once King Boris of Bulgaria dies
Byzantium often subjects Bulgaria.

Around 910 the stagnation phase kicks in and expansion grinds to a halt. Byzantium will spend most of her time dealing with populists
and claimants.

[h3] 1066 [/h3]
Byzantium struggles in this start date, with Muslim clans taking advantage of common Byzantine faction wars. The scripted
Seljuk invasion war carves a new threat into Anatolia, potentially pushing the struggle into the decline phase.

If Byzantium can hold things together then typically a power balance forms once the Muslim clans start collapsing due to
infighting.

[h3] 1178 [/h3]
I'm of the opinion that the economy in this start date is completely broken and so any attempts to balance this mod for this
start date is ultimately pointless. 

That said the buffs given to Rum it typically is able to repel Byzantium's initial attempts to annex it from the map in one war.

If Byzantium ends up allying a strong European power (e.g. France) or if Saladin takes a liking to Anatolia then Rum doesn't last long.

[h2] Compatibility [/h2]
There are a bunch of overrides (populists, rum, governor efficiency, etc...) made by this mod. It is unlikely to cause
any crashes with other mods that override these things but be aware you may get a different experience.

This mod has been designed with Cultures Expanded enabled and would recommend installing it.

I welcome any localisation mods. Please let me know if you make one, and I will add a link.
