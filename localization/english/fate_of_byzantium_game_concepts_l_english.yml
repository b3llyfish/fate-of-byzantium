 game_concept_fate_of_byzantium_struggle: "Byzantine Struggle"
 game_concept_fate_of_byzantium_struggle_desc: "The $game_concept_fate_of_byzantium_struggle$ depicts the Byzantine Empire's power through the game's timeline. The [struggle|E] differs from other struggles, as the changes between [struggle_phase_phases|E] are typically one way, though a determined Emperor can force a change in direction. The struggle can end with either the Byzantine Empire solidifying its power or outsiders causing the Empire to fracture."
 
 game_concept_struggle_phase_byzantium_optimism: "Optimism Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_byzantium_optimism_desc: "After a period of stability the streets of Constantinople are filled with rumours of a renewed western offensive. Whether it is the subjugation of the Slavs or an invasion into Italy remains to be seen. Still, both nobility and peasantry are enthused at the prospect of restoring the glory of the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\nThis enthusiasm cannot last forever though and Emperor should be wise to curtail scheming governors, lest the Empire be dragged into the [struggle_phase_byzantium_stagnation|E]. They must also do well to protect Byzantium from its enemies, as the [struggle_phase_byzantium_decline|E] may suddenly appear."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_byzantium_stagnation: "Stagnation Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_byzantium_stagnation_desc: "Schemes dominate the court of Constantinople, with self serving governors caring only about their status rather than the restoring the glory of Byzantium. A vicious cycle of corruption and deceit has ground the Empire to a halt, and it is unclear how it escapes.\n\nIf an Emperor could solidify the Empire's power then perhaps it could be bought into the [struggle_phase_byzantium_optimism|E]. If the stagnation continues thought it is only a matter of time before Byzantium's enemies exploit it, leading into the [struggle_phase_byzantium_decline|E]."
 
 game_concept_struggle_phase_byzantium_decline: "Decline Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_byzantium_decline_desc: "The enemy runs rampant through core Byzantium provinces whilst backstabbing governors bicker amongst each other. The Eastern Roman Empire is on the brink of collapse!\n\nIf by some miracle a strong Emperor is able to recover Byzantium's losses then maybe the Empire can be bought into the [struggle_phase_byzantium_optimism|E]."
