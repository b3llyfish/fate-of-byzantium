The [struggle|E] differs from other struggles, as the changes between [struggle_phase_phases|E] are typically one way, though a determined Emperor can force a change in direction.

 game_concept_struggle_phase_byzantium_optimism_desc: "After a period of stability the streets of Constantinople are filled with rumours of a renewed western offensive. Whether it is the subjugation of the Slavs or an invasion into Italy remains to be seen. Still, both nobility and peasantry are enthused at the prospect of restoring the glory of the [GetTitleByKey('e_byzantium').Custom('GameRuleByzName')|U].\n\nThis enthusiasm cannot last forever though and Emperor should be wise to curtail scheming governors, lest the Empire be dragged into the [struggle_phase_byzantium_stagnation|E].

A vicious cycle of corruption and deceit has ground the Empire to a halt, and it is unclear how it escapes.\n\nIf an Emperor could solidify the Empire's power then perhaps it could be bought into the [struggle_phase_byzantium_optimism|E]. If the stagnation continues thought it is only a matter of time before [GetTitleByKey('e_byzantium').Custom('GameRuleByzNameAdj')|U]'s enemies exploit it, leading into the [struggle_phase_byzantium_decline|E]." #NT!

The [GetTitleByKey('e_byzantium').Custom('GameRuleByzName')|U] is on the brink of collapse!\n\nIf by some miracle a strong Emperor is able to recover [GetTitleByKey('e_byzantium').Custom('GameRuleByzNameAdj')|U]'s losses then maybe the Empire can be bought into the [struggle_phase_byzantium_optimism|E]." #NT!
